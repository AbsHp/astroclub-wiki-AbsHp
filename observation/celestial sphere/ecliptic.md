## Ecliptic Coordinate System

In astronomy, the ecliptic coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system commonly used for representing the apparent positions, orbits, and [pole orientations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles_of_astronomical_bodies) of Solar System objects. Because most planets (except Mercury) and many small Solar System bodies have orbits with only slight inclinations to the [ecliptic](#ecliptic), using it as the fundamental plane is convenient.

The system's origin can be the center of either the Sun or Earth, its [primary direction](#primary-direction) is towards the [vernal equinox](./equatorial.md#vernal-equinox), and it has a right-hand convention. It may be implemented in [spherical](#spherical-coordinates) or [rectangular coordinates](#rectangular-coordinates).

The following diagram shows the Ecliptic Coordinate System (Credits: [University of Houston-Clear Lake](https://sceweb.sce.uhcl.edu/helm/WEB-Positional%20Astronomy/Tutorial/Ecliptic%20coordinates/Ecliptic%20coordinates.html)):

### Ecliptic

The ecliptic or ecliptic plane is the orbital plane of Earth around the Sun. From the perspective of an observer on Earth, the Sun's movement around the celestial sphere over the course of a year traces out a path along the ecliptic against the background of stars. The ecliptic is an important reference plane and is the basis of the [ecliptic coordinate system](#ecliptic-coordinate-system).

### Primary Direction

The [celestial equator](./equatorial.md#equator) and the [ecliptic](#ecliptic) are slowly moving due to perturbing forces on the Earth, therefore the orientation of the primary direction, their intersection at the Northern Hemisphere vernal equinox, is not quite fixed. A slow motion of Earth's axis, [precession](./equatorial.md#precession), causes a slow, continuous turning of the coordinate system westward about the poles of the ecliptic, completing one circuit in about 26,000 years. Superimposed on this is a smaller motion of the ecliptic, and a small oscillation of the Earth's axis, [nutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_nutation).
