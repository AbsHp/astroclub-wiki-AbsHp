## Galactic Coordinate System
The galactic coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system in spherical coordinates, with the Sun as its center, the primary direction aligned with the approximate center of the Milky Way Galaxy, and the fundamental plane parallel to an approximation of the galactic plane but offset to its north. It uses the right-handed convention, meaning that coordinates are positive toward the north and toward the east in the [fundamental plane](#fundamentalplane).

### Spherical Coordinates

#### Galactic Longitude

Longitude (symbol l) measures the angular distance of an object eastward along the galactic equator from the Galactic Center. Analogous to terrestrial [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude), galactic longitude is usually measured in degrees (°).

#### Galactic Latitude

Latitude (symbol b) measures the angle of an object northward of the galactic equator (or midplane) as viewed from Earth. Analogous to terrestrial [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude), galactic latitude is usually measured in degrees (°).

### Definition

The first galactic coordinate system was used by William Herschel in 1785. A number of different coordinate systems, each differing by a few degrees, were used until 1932, when Lund Observatory assembled a set of conversion tables that defined a standard galactic coordinate system based on a galactic north pole at RA 12h 40m, dec +28° (in the B1900.0 epoch convention) and a 0° longitude at the point where the galactic plane and equatorial plane intersected.
