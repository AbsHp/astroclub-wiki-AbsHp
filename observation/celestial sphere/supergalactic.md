## Supergalactic Coordinate System
The supergalactic plane is part of a reference frame for the supercluster of galaxies that contains the Milky Way galaxy.

The supergalactic plane, as so-far observed, is more or less perpendicular to the plane of the Milky Way; the angle is 84.5Â°. As viewed from Earth, the plane traces a great circle across the sky through the following constellations:

* Cassiopeia (in the Milky Way galactic plane)
* Camelopardalis
* Ursa Major
* Coma Berenices (near the Milky Way galactic north pole)
* Virgo
* Centaurus
* Circinus (in the galactic plane)
* Triangulum Australe
* Pavo
* Indus
* Grus
* Sculptor (near the galactic south pole)
* Cetus
* Pisces
* Andromeda
* Perseus
