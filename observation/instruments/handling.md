## Telescope Handling

<br />
Make sure you take good care of the [telescopes](./telescopes.html). They are expensive and fragile. If you are not sure about something, ask someone who knows. Handle the [telescopes](./telescopes.html) gently and it will serve you well.

Here is a list of do's and don'ts:

### Do's

- Be sure [telescope](./telescopes.html) is firmly attached to the wedge (i.e., DO NOT drop the [telescope](./telescopes.html))
- Place eyepieces and tools in appropriate compartments
- Be sure that the star diagonal and eyepiece are firmly attached to the [telescope](./telescopes.html)
- Loosen sets crews before rotating star diagonal or changing eyepiece. Beware of falling parts!
- Place all the equipment on the sidewalk, rather than on the grass
- Be sure apperture cover is firmly attached to the [telescope](./telescopes.html) before taking it back to the clubroom

### Don'ts

- Don't overtighten the clamps
- Don't turn the [RA](../celestial%20sphere/equatorial.html#right-ascension) fine adjustment knobs while the clamp is tightened
- Don't turn the [DEC](../celestial%20sphere/equatorial.html#declination) fine adjustment knob beyond its limit
- Don't move the [telescope](./telescopes.html) whole RA and DEC clamps are tightened
- Don't touch any glass surface ([telescope](./telescopes.html) aperture, eyepiece, star diagonal) with your fingers
- Don't grab the [telescope](./telescopes.html) by the star diagonal, visual back, eyepiece or finderscope when pointing it

### Good Advice

- Keep the box of parts and the [telescope](./telescopes.html) caps on the ground, under the tripod. They'll be out of the way and you will always know where to find them
- When not using a part, put it back in the box, not on the ground! This way you won't step on it or lose it (this is important when working in the dark)
