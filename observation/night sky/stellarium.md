## Stellarium

<br>
[Stellarium](https://stellarium.org/) is a free and open source (FOSS) [software](https://github.com/stellarium/stellarium), written in C, C++ and GLSL among others, that renders realistic skies in real-time with [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/). It is available on multiple different platforms such as [web](https://stellarium-web.org/), [desktop app](https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium/releases/), [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noctuasoftware.stellarium_free) and [app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stellarium-mobile-star-map/id1458716890).

It is recommended to download the application on your phone as it is much easier to carry and reference from as compared to from a laptop or a desktop.

The Stellarium user guide in its entirety can be found [here](https://stellarium.org/files/guide.pdf).
