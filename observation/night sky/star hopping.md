## Star Hopping

<br />
Assuming you've been blindfolded, spun around, and dropped in the middle of a forest, how would you find your way out? You'd probably look for landmarks, like a river or a mountain, and then use those landmarks to find your way out. This is the same idea behind [star hopping](#star-hopping). You use bright stars and [constellations](./constellations.html) as landmarks to find your way around the night sky.

### Hand Measurements

Nature has provided us with a rudimentary angle measurer: our hands. If you hold your hand out at arm's length, you can measure the distance between any two points in the night sky. Then, the width of your:

- Little finger is about 1 degree
- First three fingers packed together is about 5 degrees
- Fist is about 10 degrees
- Outstretched index to little finger in a 'YO' hand position is about 15 degrees
- Outstretched thumb to little finger in a 'Call Me' hand position is about 25 degrees

This is a very rough estimate, but it's good enough to get you started. The following illustration explains this in more detail (Credits: [TimeAndData](https://www.timeanddate.com/)):

### Polaris

Assuming you know the latitude you're at, you can use [Polaris](#polaris) to find your way around the night sky. [Polaris](#polaris) is the brightest star in the constellation of [Ursa Minor](./constellations.html#ursa-minor), and it is located almost directly over the North Celestial [Pole](../celestial%20sphere/equatorial.html#poles). This means that if you're in the Northern Hemisphere, you can use [Polaris](#polaris) to find North.

### Big Dipper

The [Big Dipper](#big-dipper) is a very prominent [asterism](./constellations.html#asterisms) in the night sky. It is part of the constellation of [Ursa Major](./constellations.html#ursa-major), and it is visible almost all year round in the Northern Hemisphere. It is a great starting point for [star hopping](#star-hopping) as it is easily locatable and lies near the North Celestial [Pole](../celestial%20sphere/equatorial.html#poles) (NCP).

Extending a straight line joining $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ Ursa Major, we find the star [Polaris](#polaris).

Extending the stars on the tail in the arc, we come to Arcturus of [Bootes](./constellations.html#bootes), the Herdsman. Extending this arc in a straight line, we reach the star Spica of [Virgo](./constellations.html#virgo), the Virgin, which is the second largest in the [night sky](../night%20sky/).

The [Big Dipper](#big-dipper) also points to other important stars. You can follow the two stars across the top of the cup and they lead you to the northernmost bright star, Capella, in the [constellation](./constellations.html) [Auriga](./constellations.html#auriga). If, instead of going up from the front of the cup, you go down from the back of the cup, you end up at the star Regulus in the [constellation](./constellations.html) [Leo](./constellations.html#leo). And if you go across the cup, from the back top to the bottom front, you end up at Castor in [Gemini](./constellations.html#gemini). You can continue that line on until you get to Betelgeuse in [Orion](./constellations.html#orion), the brilliant red star in the west.
