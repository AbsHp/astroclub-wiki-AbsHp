## Etiquettes

<br />
To make the night sky observation a great experience for yourself as well as others, there are some [etiquettes](#etiquettes) that you must follow. These include but are not limited to:

1. No White Lights after Dark! Use dim [red lights](./miscellaneous.html#red-lights) after sundown. Use only the minimum light necessary for safety. If you must use lights, please ask first, to avoid spoiling someone's night vision or astrophoto. Shield Shelter your light with your body, [telescope](../instruments/telescopes.html), car or whatever to minimize glare.
2. Before approaching a [telescope](../instruments/telescopes.html) ask if the owner is doing [photography](../../astrophotography/) or imaging. If they are, be careful not to step in front of the field of view of the [telescope](../instruments/telescopes.html) or [lens](../instruments/eyepieces.html). Especially don’t wave a light around in the vicinity.
3. When using Green [laser pointers](./miscellaneous.html#laser-pointers) please do so sparingly as they DO affect night vision.
4. If using a computerised Star Chart PLEASE DO USE the Night Mode.
5. Don’t touch other people’s equipment or [lenses](../instruments/eyepieces.html). If you do accidentally touch someone else’s [lens](../instruments/eyepieces.html) or [eyepiece](../instruments/eyepieces.html), perhaps smudging it in the process, don’t try to clean it yourself. Apologize to the affected party and let them decide what to do.
6. Sharing views is a benefit to finder and seeker, but please ask before you look through another’s [telescope](../instruments/telescopes.html). Better yet, wait until you are invited.
7. Keep food and drink away from [telescopes](../instruments/telescopes.html). If there are children present, keep a close eye on them.
8. The last two people should sweep the area with their flashlights to see if anyone accidentally dropped something important. If you find anything left behind, contact the club [coordinator](../../club/teams/recruitment.html#coordinator) the next day and then bring the item with you to the next meeting to be re-united with its owner.
