## Constellations

<br>
A constellation is a pattern of stars in the night sky. The word is derived from the Latin word "constellacio", which means "set of stars". There are 88 official constillations, all with well defined boundaries. The boundaries of the constellations were defined in 1930 by the [International Astronomical Union](https://www.iau.org/) (IAU).

Some examples of constellations are:

1. Ursa Major
2. Orion
3. Crux
4. Taurus

## Asterisms

<br>
Asterisms are relatively new. Many of them are small patterns, often within a constellation, and some are made of bright stars from more than one constellation. There is nothing official about asterisms, and there are no rules about how big or small they should be. They are just patterns that people have noticed in the night sky and are easily recognizable.

Some examples of asterisms are:

1. The Big Dipper (part of Ursa Major)
2. The Southern Cross (part of Crux)
3. The Summer Triangle (made of stars from Cygnus - Deneb, Lyra - Vega, and Aquila - Altair)
4. Pleiades (part of Taurus)

## Stars

<br>
The 88 [constellations](./constellations.html#constellations) are all given three-letter abbreviations that help identify them. Stars that lie within a constellation boundary are referred to with these three-letter codes. In addition, stargazers often use what's called the genitive form of the constellation name. For example, the genetive form of Orion is _Orionis_. So, if you are referring to a star in Orion, you would call it "something Orionis".

The brightest stars in any constellation are usually the ones that are used to make up the pattern, and many of the bright stars stand out so much that they’ve been given proper names. Regardless of whether a star has a proper name or not, though, the bright ones all have Greek letters associated with them.

### Bayer letters

The brightest star in any constellation is usually given the designation _alpha_, represented by the Greek letter α, while the second brightest is _beta_, β and so on. There Greek letters are known as _Bayer_ letters.

When a star is bright enough to be given its own Bayer letter, that Greek letter is added as a prefix to the three-letter constellation abbreviations. So, if you see a star named as α, many times, it's the brightest one in that constellation.

### Proper names

Some of the brightest stars have a proper name, which you can use interchangeably with the star's Bayer designation. For example, the brightest star in the constellation Carina is called _Canopus_, and it also has the Bayer designation α-Carinae. Most stars have proper names from Latin, Greek or Arabic.
