## Visibility

### Bortle Dark-Sky Scale

It is a nine-level numeric scale that measures the night sky's and the stars' brightness (naked-eye and stellar limiting magnituded) of a prticular location. It quantifies the observability of celestial objects and the interference caused by [light pollution](./visibility.html#light-pollution) and sky glow.

John E. Bortle created the scale to help amateur astronomers compare the darkness of observing sites. The scale ranges from class 1, the darkest skies available on Earth, through class 9, inner-sky cities. The following image shows the Bortle classes and illustrates the relation it has to the visibility of celestial objects in the night sky.

[IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) lies in Bortle class 6. The darkest skies in India are in Ladakh, which is Bortle class 2, where the [Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle](https://www.iiap.res.in/?q=centres_iao.htm) and India's first Dark Sky Reserve is located. The lowest Bortle class in the world is 1, which is found in Antarctica. You can use the [Light Pollution Map Info](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/) to find the Bortle class of any location on Earth.
