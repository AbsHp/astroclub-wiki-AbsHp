## Parhelia

<br />
[Parhelia](#parhelia), also known as sundogs or mock suns, are atmospheric phenomena comprising of bright spots on either side of the Sun. They are created by the refraction of sunlight through ice crystals in the atmosphere.

Most commonly seen in the morning or evening, [parhelia](#parhelia) are best observed when the Sun is low in the sky. They are often accompanied by a 22 degree halo, which is a ring of light around the Sun.

An astounding shot of [Parhelia](#parhelia) was captured by Claudia Hinz, in Czech Republic:

> A similar phenomenon can be seen around the Moon, known as paraselenae. Analogus to mock suns, they're known as mock moons. These are also caused by the refraction of light through ice crystals, but are much rarer than [parhelia](#parhelia).
