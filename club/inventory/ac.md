## Air Conditioner

<br />
You must be thinking, "Why is an Air Conditioner listed among the club's inventory?". Good question. A bit dumb as well.

If you think about it, the clubroom is located at the rooftop of the New SAC building, which is a concrete structure. Not to mention that it has floor-to-ceiling glass on two sides of the room. On top of it, there is a fully enclosed [planetarium](./planetarium.html) inside, leaving virtually no opportunity of ventilation at all. Believe us when we say that it gets **really** hot in the summers. The [AC](#air-conditioner) is a truly a need and a lifesaver.

> The Astronomy Club is the only entity of the SnT Council that has an [air-conditioner](#air-conditioner) it its clubroom. It is also one of the only two entities (the other being Music Club) of the Students' Gymkhana to have air conditioned room(s).

Generations of club members and campus junta have enjoyed [planetarium shows](../expositions/planetarium%20shows.html) under the coolness due to the [air-conditioner](#air-conditioner). A blessing indeed. Quite good sleep quality can be attained during the summers.
