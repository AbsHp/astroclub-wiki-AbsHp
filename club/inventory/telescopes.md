## Telescopes

<br />
The club has an array of [telescopes](#telescopes) in its [inventory](../inventory/). Some small and portable, some regular sized, and some large and heavy. Without further ado, here is the list of the [telescopes](#telescopes):

### AstroMaster 130EQ (x2)

One of the most popular [telescopes](#telescopes), both due to its price and ease of usage, [AstroMaster 130EQ](#astromaster-130eq-x2) are one of the most reliable and durable [telescopes](#telescopes). Made by Celestron, the 130 represents the apperture of the [telescope](#telescopes), with it being 130 $$mm$$ in diameter and EQ represents the mount it is on, which is an equatorial one. The [telescope](#telescopes) is a [Newtonian reflector](../../observation/instruments/telescopes.html#newtonian-reflector) and has a focal length of 650 $$mm$$, which gives it a focal ratio of $$f/5$$. It comes with two eyepieces, a 10 $$mm$$ and a 20 $$mm$$, which gives it a magnification of 65x and 32.5x respectively. The [telescope](#telescopes) also comes with a 2x Barlow lens, which doubles the magnification of the eyepiece. Equipped with a red dot finder, which helps in pointing the [telescope](#telescopes) to the desired object, the [AstroMaster 130EQ](#astromaster-130eq-x2) is a great [telescope](#telescopes) for beginners and intermediate users alike.

### Orion SpaceProbe 130ST EQ

As versatile as the [AstroMaster 130EQ](#astromaster-130eq-x2) but heavily underrated, the [Orion SpaceProbe 130ST EQ](#orion-spaceprobe-130st-eq) is also one of the gems in the club's [inventory](../inventory/) of [telescopes](#telescopes). The ST here stands for "Short Tube". A shorter tube length gives a wider field of view, which is better for [deep space objects](../../observation/night%20sky/deep%20sky%20objects.html) like galaxies and nebulaes.

### Skywatcher 130PM

Skywatcher is another one of the popular brands. Just like its cousins above, the [Skywatcher 130PM](#skywatcher-130pm) is also a [newtonian telescope](../../observation/instruments/telescopes.html#newtonian-reflector) with an apperture of 130 $$mm$$. The **P** here stands for the "Parabolic" mirror it has as its primary mirror. The **M** here stands for the "Motorized
" version. That is, it is completely automated and can track the rotation of the Earth, and hence is useful for long exposure tracked [astrophotography](../../astrophotography/).
