## Bulla

<br />
If you're a person who isn't familiar with IIT Kanpur's lingo, **[Bulla](#bulla)**, it is essentially something a group of people does where there is either nothing to do or too much to do. A typical [bulla](#bulla) involves meaningless talks for hours at and end. Conversations may also include heated up discussions. A [bulla](#bulla) session generally ends with a grand GPL session (if spirits are high).

Unfortunately, these [bulla](#bulla) sessions of the club are reserved _exclusively_ for the [secretaries](../teams/recruitment.html#secretary) and [coordinators](../teams/recruitment.html#coordinator) of the club (due to restrictions being placed on the access of OAT rooftop). They are a perfect opportunity to rant about stuff and enjoy each other's company.

During a normal [bulla](#bulla) session at the clubroom, the mattresses inside the [planetarium](../inventory/planetarium.html) are pulled out and spread out on the roof of the Senate Hall. With conversations ranging about day-to-day activities to _literally anything_, it is a given that one enjoys a ton! Sometimes, the sessions can last till day-break, in which case if the following day is a day off, we just switch on the [air conditioner](../inventory/ac.html) and sleep until it's time for lunch.

> Some of the wildest endaevours and amazing initiatives have come as a result of these [bulla](#bulla) sessions. So, they're not totally pointless and do serve a higher purpose. Or that's how we convey their importance to people and convice ourselves in the process.
