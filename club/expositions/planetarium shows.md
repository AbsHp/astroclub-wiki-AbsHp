## Planetarium Shows

<br />
What good would a [planetarium](../inventory/planetarium.html) be without [planetarium shows](#planetarium-shows)? [Inaugurated](../inventory/planetarium.html#inauguration) back in 2013, the [planetarium](../inventory/planetarium.html) has withstood the test of time and continues to be a source of wonder and awe for students and faculty alike. We've been organizing [planetarium shows](#planetarium-shows) for the better past of the past decade for the freshmen, and they've become a staple of the club.

Due to security issues pertaining to the accessibilty of rooftop by non-club members, conducting [planetarium shows](#planetarium-shows) was considered impossible post COVID. But as we do with everything we set our eyes on, we persevered and pushed our way forward, allowing for every new batch to experience the joy of [planetarium shows](#planetarium-shows), sometimes even being the first of many shows they see.

If you're a faculty reading this and would like to plan a visit to the planetarium for you and your family, you're most invited! You can contact any of the current [coordinators](../teams/recruitment.html#coordinator) or drop us a mail!

> Not just for [planetarium shows](#planetarium-shows), the [planetarium](../inventory/planetarium.html) can also be used to (and is used to :) stream movies, matches or even play games, a perk that comes with becoming a [secretary](../teams/recruitment.html#secretary) or a [coordinator](../teams/recruitment.html#coordinator) of Astronomy Club, IIT Kanpur!

A few security guidelines to keep in mind:

- The [planetarium shows](#planetarium-shows) will be usually conducted between 8:30 PM and 10:30 PM
- The slots for each show will be 10 minutes with an additional 5 minutes of buffer
- Per slot, a maximum of 6 students shall be permitted to avoid over-crowing
- Students must arrive atleast 2-3 minutes prior to their allotted slot with the institute issued ID card or health booklet
- One [secretary](../teams/recruitment.html#secretary) will be present at the rooftop gate and another on the staircase from the second floor at the time of arrival of the students.
- There will also be a [coordinator](../teams/recruitment.html#coordinator) overseeing all this
- These three students will ensure that no one except the students who have their booking are coming to the building rooftop during the event
- Students' name and roll number will be cross-checked using their ID cards
- A CIS Security guard will also be present near the OAT staircase to further help ensure no crowding of students and smoother management for event conduction
- Show booking will be initially available for the freshmen via an online platform with the aim of being open to all the students
