## Introductory Lecture

<br />
Throughout our existence, humanity has been captivated by the vastness and majesty of heaven. Countless puzzles still persist in our understanding of the universe despite the brightest minds of all time ever-attempting to apprehend the vastness of the cosmos, and we, the inhabitants of this interstellar vessel called Earth, work tirelessly in pursuit of enlightenment.

Let us take you on a journey into the depths of the universe and explore the achievements of our club. From club functioning, activities, meticulous observations and the art of astrophotography, to the intricacies of data analysis, to discussions on the boundaries of astrophysics and cosmology, you will explore every aspect in this cosmic adventure.

Usually conducted in the first week of September, the [introductory lecture](#introductory-lecture) is a 2-hour long session conducted by the club to introduce the freshers to the world of astronomy, and to the club itself. The lecture is conducted by the club's core team members, and is followed by a Q&A session, where the freshers can ask any questions they have about the club, or about astronomy in general.

It is always exciting to see budding young minds come together, ask questions, and explore their answers, however weird or mind-boggling they might be.
