## Star Parties

<br />
What kind of Astronomy Club would we be if we didn't engage in one of the most fun activities in astronomy? As the name suggests, it's a party under the stars!

One of the most awaited events of the year, the club tries to organize star parties every semester, usually just after the mid semester examinations but just before the mid semester break, preferably on a moonless night. Open to all, including professors and their families, institute workers and of course the campus junta, they're a great way to get to know the night sky and the club members.

> Fun Fact
>
> The club caters to an astounding audience of more than 3,500 people every time a [star party](#star-parties) is organized! To put that into perspective, there are 8,000 students in the institute.

Held at the Airstrip, far away from the hustle-bustle of hostels, the [star parties](#star-parties) are a great way to get away from the artificial lights, observe the night sky and blow off a lof of post examination stress.

Conducted entirely by the club [secretaries](../teams/recruitment.html#secretary) and [coordinators](../teams/recruitment.html#coordinator) and with a theme in mind (usually planet observation like Jupiter or Saturn opposition), participants are giving a brief yet thorough knowledge of the event before taking them to the telescopes. The club brings 2 to 3 telescopes and binoculars, looking through which leaves the viewer stunned and in awe.

To further enhance the experience, the club also brings along a laser pointer to point out constellations and other celestial objects. The icing on the cake is that unlike regular [star parties](#star-parties), these go on for two nights, giving everyone a chance to attend.
