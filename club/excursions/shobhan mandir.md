## Shobhan Mandir

<br />
Around an hour's drive from campus, lies [Shobhan Mandir](#shobhan-mandir), a popular one in and around Kanpur. Being around 20 $$km$$ away from the light pollution of the city, the sky has  very less light pollution and on a clear night, you can even see the milky way!

Every year, we organize a trip to [Shoban Mandir](#shobhan-mandir), leaving campus around 6 PM via a chartered bus, usually on a weekend night, loaded with around 30 people, reaching our destination by 7 PM, and spread the tarpauline we carried all the way from the clubroom on the field, lay down and observe the stars for the better part of the night.

We chit-chat, explore the surroundings, have multiple [bulla](../expositions/bulla.html) sessions and of course use the [telescopes](../../observation/instruments/telescopes.html) to watch the wonders of the [night sky](../../observation/night%20sky/). Filled with fun, joy and laughter, we dine together. A few of us get tired and turn in early, others roam around the village, exploring it under the moonless [night sky](../../observation/night%20sky/). Early morning around 6 AM, we pack up our things and head back to campus, reaching our halls by 7:30 AM, just in time for breakfast and then head straight to sleep. If it's a particularly hot or humid weather, the [air-conditioner](../inventory/ac.html) inside the [planetarium](../inventory/planetarium.html) breathes a new life into us and we sleep there.

If you want to plan a trip there, you can look up "Observation Hub at Shobhan, Astro-Club IITk" on Google Maps and you'll get the location. Alternatively, here it is:
