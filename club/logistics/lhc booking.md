## Lecture Hall Complex booking

<br />
Lecture Halls are the place where the majority of [expositions](../expositions/) and [workshops](../workshops/) take place. And as always, there is a procedure to book a lecture hall for club use:

0. Visit the LHC Office in front of L7 to check if the Lecture Hall you want to book is available during the time slot(s) on the required day(s).
1. Fill up the [SG3 Lecture Hall Booking](../../assets/docs/club/logistics/lhc%20booking/SG3%20Lecture%20Hall%20Booking%20Form.pdf) form, filling up all that you require.
2. Bills are settled by the Science and Technology Council for Astronomy Club.
3. Get the form signed by the General Secretary of the SnT Council, who resides in Hall 1
4. Get the form signed by the Faculty Advisor of the SnT Council.
5. Submit the form in the Dean of Students' Affairs (DoSA) office, to get the signature of the Dean or ADSA.
6. Once you've got all three signatures, submit the form to the LHC Office in front of L7. The lecture hall's now booked!

Note that the payment for usage of Lecture Hall by Astronomy Club is not beared by the budget alloted to the club, but rather, by the SnT Council itself.
