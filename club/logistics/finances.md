## Club Finances

<br />
The club is financed by the Science and Technology Council, which in turn gets its funding directly from the Dean of Students' Administration. If you look closely into your semester fees, you'll see a heading called "Gymkhana Fees". This covers the budget of the entire Students' Gymkhana in a given financial year.

When purchasing anything for the club, try to buy items that cost less than INR 25,000. First and foremost, get the [Pre-Approval](../../assets/docs/club/logistics/finances/Pre-Approval%20Form.pdf) form signed by the General Secretary of the SnT Council. You can acquire inventory using either of the two ways mentioned below:

> When you purchase something for the club, make sure you get the GST invoice(s). This is necessary for both [advance](#advances) clearance and [reimbursement](#reimbursments).

### Advances

Getting an [advance](#advances) is the easiest way to acquire inventory for the club. The procedure for this is as follows:

0. Make sure you've got signed the [Pre-Approval](../../assets/docs/club/logistics/finances/Pre-Approval%20Form.pdf).
1. Fill up the [SG1 Advance Request](../../assets/docs/club/logistics/finances/SG1%20Advance%20Request%20Form.pdf) form. Get it signed by both the General Secretary of the SnT Council and the Finance Convener, both of who reside in Hall 1.
2. Attach the [Pre-Approval](../../assets/docs/club/logistics/finances/Pre-Approval%20Form.pdf) form to the [SG1 Advance Request](../../assets/docs/club/logistics/finances/SG1%20Advance%20Request%20Form.pdf) form and submit it to the Snt Council's faculty advisor to request his signature.
3. Once you've got the faculty advisor's signature, submit the form to the office in New SAC.
4. If there are not that many upheld advances, you'll get the money within a week or two.
5. Purchase the items you require.

Once you've done all this, you'll need to clear the [advance](#advances) you've borrowed. To do so, the procedure is as follows:

0. If there is some left over amount, transfer it to the General Secretary and request a transaction statement from him.
1. Fill up the [SG16 Advance Clearance](../../assets/docs/club/logistics/finances/SG16%20Advance%20Clearance%20Form.pdf) form and attach the GST innvoice(s) to it. Get it signed by both the General Secretary of the SnT Council and the Finance Convener, both of who reside in Hall 1.
2. Submit them to the SnT Council's faculty advisor to request his signature.
3. Once you've got the faculty advisor's signature, submit the form to the office in New SAC, and verify with them the inventory you've purchased.
4. If you've gone over budget marginally (INR 1000), you will automatically be reimbursed for that. You don't need to follow the [reimbursement](#reimbursments) procedure.

### Reimbursments

If you're in a time crunch and need some stuff urgently for the club and are unable to get an [advance](#advances), you can purchase the items yourself and get reimbursed later for the same. The procedure for this is as follows:

0. Make sure you've got signed the [Pre-Approval](../../assets/docs/club/logistics/finances/Pre-Approval%20Form.pdf).
1. Fill up the [SG2 Bill Clearance](../../assets/docs/club/logistics/finances/SG2%20Bil%20Clearance%20Form.pdf) form and attach the GST invoice(s) to it. Get it signed by both the General Secretary of the SnT Council and the Finance Convener, both of who reside in Hall 1.
2. Attach the [Pre-Approval](../../assets/docs/club/logistics/finances/Pre-Approval%20Form.pdf) form and GST invoice(s) to the [SG2 Bill Clearance](../../assets/docs/club/logistics/finances/SG2%20Bil%20Clearance%20Form.pdf) form and submit it to the Snt Council's faculty advisor to request his signature.
3. Once you've got the faculty advisor's signature, submit the form to the office in New SAC, and verify with them the inventory you've purchased. You'll be reimbursed within a week or two.

### LPC

If you wish to purchase an item that is worth over INR 25,000 for the club, you'll need to fill up an [LPC](#lpc) form. For further details regarding this, contact the General Secretary or the Finance Converner.
