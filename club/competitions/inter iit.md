## Inter IIT Tech Meet

<br />
The [Inter-IIT Tech Meet](#inter-iit-tech-meet) is one of the, if not the most important and prestigeous [competitions](./) the club paritipates in. Participants from 22 IITs compete in this annual showdown to prove their mettle in the fields of science and technology.

Ever since the inception of [Inter-IIT Tech Meet](#inter-iit-tech-meet) in 2012, Astronomy Club has excelled in astro-specific problem statements, achieving podium finishes **every single time**. Be it Messeir Marathon, Data Analysis or Case Studies, the club has never failed to make its mark and have always helped the contingent of IIT Kanpur win laurels year after year. All this motivates us to preserve out legacy and work & prepare even harder than the year before.

### Tech Meet 11.0

Hosted at our home ground of IIT Kanpur, the problem statement of [Tech Meet 11.0](#tech-meet-110) was "The Chandrayaan Moon Mapping Challenge by ISRO". The problem statement was split into two parts:

1. Development of an AI/ML model to generate high (~30 cm) resolution lunar terrain image from medium/low (5 m / 10 m) resolution terrain image, and evaluate its accuracy; the model will be amenable to further training and improvement.
2. To generate a global lunar atlas (digital) with the help of the AI/ML model, based on the medium / low resolution data available. The AI/ML model to be developed by using the publically available overlapping data of OHRC (~30 cm resolution) and TMC-2 (5 m /10 m resolution) payload data on board Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter.

We secured the **bronze medal** in the competition. The solution to this problem statement constructed by the contingent of IIT Kanpur can be found at [astroclubiitk/Inter-IIT-Tech-Meet-2023](https://github.com/astroclubiitk/Inter-IIT-Tech-Meet-2023).

### Tech Meet 10.0

Hosted in an online mode by IIT Kharagpur, the problem statement of [Tech Meet 10.0](#tech-meet-100) was "Web-based Automatic Identification of Solar Bursts in X-ray Light Curves by ISRO". In brief, the problem statement asked us to build a stand-alone web-based application using open-source software(s) to identify and categorize X-ray bursts. Given data included long-duration X-ray light curves as well. Parameters like the rise and decay time, peak flux, duration of bursts, etc., also had to be derived. False detection should be minimum, and all bursts must be detected. The problem statement can be broadly categorized into two parts:

1. Developing a statistical/machine learning model to cover the mentioned parameters.
2. Deploying it efficiently to a stand-alone application and web-based tool (no additional APIs used).

We secured the **third position** in the competition. The solution to this problem statement constructed by the contingent of IIT Kanpur can be found at [astroclubiitk/Inter-IIT-Tech-Meet-2023](https://github.com/astroclubiitk/Inter-IIT-Tech-Meet-2023).

### Tech Meet 9.0

Hosted in an online mode by IIT Guwahati, the problem statement of [Tech Meet 9.0](#tech-meet-90) was "Web Based Visualization Tool for Astrosat Observations by ISRO". The problem statement was solved in two parts:

1. The cleaning and processing of data provided in the forms of catalogs A and B, and the publications. The source names have been resolved using SIMBAD and is accurate upto atleast 2 arcmin. Cited sources have been extracted from the publications using regular expressions, which exploit the astro nomencalture to cature the source names from the title and abstracts.
2. Use of the available data from one of the thoroughly observed sources to derive meaningful results based on the type of astronomical object being observed.

We secured the **silver medal** in the competition. The solution to this problem statement constructed by the contingent of IIT Kanpur can be found at [astroclubiitk/Inter-IIT-Tech-Meet-2021](https://github.com/astroclubiitk/Inter-IIT-Tech-Meet-2023).
