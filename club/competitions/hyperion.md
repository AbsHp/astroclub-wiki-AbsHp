## Hyperion

<br />
An open to all competition for undergraduate and postgraduate students of any institute acress India, majoring in any stream, [Hyperion](#hyperion) is a nation-wide case study challenge.

[Hyperion](#hyperion) strives to make students think critically and creatively to solve a baseline developed Case Study problem, where an individual will get the glimpse of basic mix and match of astronomy with interesting anecdotes. The competition is premised to promote students to come up with innovative solutions to work out the questions proposed in Case Study, shaping their understanding in Astronomy. Participants are expected to deliver well-probed and accurate solution(s) to the case study/problem provided by us.

It is a unique opportunity for the students to test their basic knowledge and get hands-on experience in solving a case study problem, and help them sharpen their writing and analytical skills as they submit their solution and present it before the peers.

From Dark Matter density calcaulation to Gravitational waves from black hole mergers, we try to cover the hottest topics in the fields of Astronomy and Astrophysics and apply concepts of Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science to solve the problems, often with the help of data analysis.
