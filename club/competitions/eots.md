## Eyes on the Skies

<br />
A freshers exclusive competition, [Eyes on the Skies](#eyes-on-the-skies) (EOTS) is aimed at budding astronomy enthusiasts to compete with their peers. It involves two sub-competitions, namely [astrophotography](#astrophotography) and [astro-riddles](#astro-riddles).

### Astrophotography

An exciting domain of astronomy, [astrophotography](../../astrophotography/) is probably one of the, if not the most loved and represented domains of astronomy. And it what would inspire young astronomers as well as an [astrophotography](#astrophotography) challenge?

The beauty of this competition? You don't need a DSLR or a fancy camera to take amazing shots of the cosmos! A conventional smartphone is more than enough! You can capture jaw-dropping [star trails](../../astrophotography/star%20trails) and [lunar shots](../../astrophotography/moon.md) using an ordinary smartphone camera. Just tweak the settings of your phone's camera in the pro-mode, remeber them and fire away.

The scale has a dear son, Who was once stolen by another one. The thief was sent to kill a huntsman. Putting an end to his lifespan. Yet another victim was part of the slaughter, the one who the huntsman had his eye on, killed by his sister
