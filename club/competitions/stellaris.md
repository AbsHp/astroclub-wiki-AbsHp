## Stellaris

<br />
An astro trivia trek, in collaboration with the [Quiz Club, IITK](https://www.instagram.com/qciitk), we bring to you Stellaris, a quiz on all things space. Consider yourself an astronomy enthusiast? Are you fascinated by the wonders of the universe and beyond? If so, this is **the** event for you!

Conducted in an online mode via Zoom, usually in the even semester, [Stellaris](#stellaris) is an event that is open to all batches. It is conducted in two parts, both on the same day:

1. A preliminary round, conducted on Google Forms. This round is open to all batches, and the top teams are selected for the final round.
2. The final round. This is a buzzer round.

You can choose to participate as a lone wolf or in teams of two.
