Across the cosmos, there exist awe-inspiring phenomena that emit immense amounts of energy, captivating astronomers and unveiling the extreme forces shaping the universe. [Energetic sources](#energetic-sources) encompass a wide array of celestial marvels, from [pulsars](../special%20stars/pulsars.html) and [quasars](./quasars.html) to [gamma-ray bursts](./GRBs.html) and [active galactic nuclei](./AGNs.html). These phenomena produce staggering amounts of energy, often outshining entire galaxies or releasing more energy in seconds than our Sun will emit in its entire lifetime. Exploring these cosmic powerhouses offers insights into the most extreme conditions in the universe, helping us understand the nature of [black holes](../special%20stars/black%20holes.html), the mechanisms behind colossal explosions, and the origin of high-energy particles that traverse space.
