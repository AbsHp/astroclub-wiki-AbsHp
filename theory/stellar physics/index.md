## Stellar Physics

<br />
[Stellar physics](#stellar-physics) serves as the gateway to understanding the remarkable lives of stars, the celestial entities that illuminate the cosmos. This field explores the birth, [evolution](./evolution.html), and eventual fate of stars, unraveling their intricate behaviors and fundamental properties. From the nuclear fusion processes that fuel their brilliance to the diverse life cycles of stars based on their masses, compositions, and sizes, [stellar physics](#stellar-physics) reveals the secrets behind the light that fills our night sky. By delving into topics such as stellar formation, classification, and the breathtaking phenomena of [supernovae](../energetic%20sources/supernovae.html) and [black holes](../special%20stars/black%20holes.html), we gain insights into the immense forces shaping our universe.
