## Newtonian Gravity

<br />
Yes, gravity has been defined by multiple people, multiple times. One of them, the most famous one, is Sir Isaac Newton. One of the most far-reaching scientific laws ever formulated, Newton's law of universal gravitation is the basis of [celestial mechanics](../celestial%20mechanics/) and astrodynamics.

With deceptive simplicity, the law is stated as follows:

> "Every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle of matter with a force directly proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of distance between them."

Mathematically, it can be stated as:

$$
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    F &\propto \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\
    F &= G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

where:

- $$m_1$$ and $$m_2$$ are the masses of the two particles / bodies
- $$r$$ is the distance between them
- $$G$$ is the universal constant of gravitation

The universal constant of gravitation, $$G$$, is a constant of proportionality that is dependent on the units used to measure mass and distance. It is a very small number, and is usually expressed in scientific notation as:

$$
\begin{equation}
  G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \frac{m^3}{kg \cdot s^2}
\end{equation}
$$

The force of gravity is a vector quantity, and is directed along the line joining the two bodies. The force is attractive, i.e. it is directed towards the other body.
