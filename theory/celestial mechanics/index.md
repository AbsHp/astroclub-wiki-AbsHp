## Celestial Mechanics

<br />
[Celestial mechanics](#celestial-mechanics) forms the bedrock of our understanding of how celestial bodies move and interact within the vast expanse of space. This field of study delves into the mathematical principles governing the motions of planets, moons, stars, and other celestial objects. By applying Newton's laws of motion and [gravitation](./newtonian%20gravity.html), as well as Einstein's theory of general relativity, astronomers unravel the complexities of orbital dynamics, gravitational interactions, and celestial phenomena. From elucidating the orbits of planets to predicting celestial events like eclipses and cometary paths, [celestial mechanics](#celestial-mechanics) provides us with the tools to comprehend the elegant dance of celestial bodies in the cosmic ballet. Join us on this fascinating journey as we delve deeper into the mechanics that govern the celestial wonders above.
