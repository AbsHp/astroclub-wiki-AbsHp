# Welcome to Astronomy Club, IIT Kanpur!

## Who we are

We are a group of highly enthusiastic students from IIT Kanpur who love to appreciate the beauty of the cosmos. Not all of us have formal background in astronomy, but we are passionate about what our universe has to offer. The club is open to all the students: from the freshers to the final years and from the post-graduates to the ones doing their PhDs. The club consists of not only Physics majors but students across all departments. All you need is just a little interest in the stars and not even that, spend time with us and we'll make sure that you will fall in love with the cosmos because you yourself are made of stardust. So, even if you think that variable stars are demons trapped in a mysterious realm or that comets are omens of that war, we invite you to come and join us.

## Purpose of this wiki

This website serves as a centralized knowledge repository. This helps in preserving knowledge for current and future members. It will also contain the full range of activities done by the club in the past and present, along with a few easter eggs regarding upcoming events. Hosting the wiki publically also allows open-source [contributions](#contributing) to further enhance the collective knowledge and let the campus junta be a part of the club even more.

## Contributing

You can also contribute to the wiki by forking the official [Astronomy Club IITK Wiki](https://github.com/astroclubiitk/wiki) github repository, updating it, and submitting a PR. Your contributions will be accepted and the website will be updated within 24 hours (most probably).
